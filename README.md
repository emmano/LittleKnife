LittleKnife
===========

Simple View injection framework to be used as a tool for learning compile-time Annotation Processing 

###What is LittleKnife?

LittleKnife is a minimal, functional,  oversimplification of a View "injection" framework like [ButterKnife](https://github.com/JakeWharton/butterknife).

###What is the motivation behind LittleKnife?

I have been using libraries that use Annotations for some time now, and I always felt that it would be nice to actually understand how these libraries used Annotations to, for example, initialize my `Views`. I always felt that there was this huge amount of magic that goes one that I really didn't understand, so I started by looking at the `ButterKnife` source code and thought it would be nice to share a simplified version of it, so other developers trying to learn Annotation Processing  do not feel overwhelmed and lose interest.
